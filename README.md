# React Form interacting with localstorage

## Description
This is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application with a React client, using localstorage for storing data.

## User Interface / Client
<kbd><img src="./form.png" alt="Simple user interface." width="700px"/></kbd>

The form shown above is used to execute the CRUD operations. I included quite a lot of input fields in order to handle many data types. 

The React app includes the following techniques:
- [Controlled inputs](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/input#controlling-an-input-with-a-state-variable) for good practice on how to handle form data.
- [Axios package](https://axios-http.com/) to make http requests to the Web API.

When using "Update" and "Delete" you have to first select the item in the list at the right.
